# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This HTML document creates a simple yet engaging Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design features a full-page background image related to the game theme, ensuring a visually appealing backdrop. The content is centered within a container to enhance the user experience.

The <head> section links to an external CSS file and includes inline CSS for additional styling. The background image is set to cover the entire viewport and is centered without repeating, providing a consistent and immersive visual effect. The container holds the game title and control buttons. The title is prominently displayed with a background color, padding, and shadow to stand out against the background image.

Three buttons—Rock, Paper, and Scissors—are styled uniformly with a class named button. These buttons are well-sized and padded for easy interaction, with a background color that contrasts with the page for visibility. When a button is clicked, the fun(user) JavaScript function is triggered, passing the selected choice as an argument.

The JavaScript function generates a random choice for the computer and compares it with the user's choice to determine the outcome. The function updates the content of three HTML elements to show the user's choice, the computer’s choice, and the result of the game (win, lose, or tie). The results are displayed in a designated section, ensuring clear and immediate feedback to the user.

Overall, this setup provides an intuitive and enjoyable gaming experience. The combination of a well-designed interface, interactive elements, and straightforward game logic ensures that users can easily play and understand the game, making it a fun and accessible web-based activity.
